##### 2021/03/02

- New table: Legendia 
   - Features: Party Formation Editor
  
 - New feature: Phantasia
	 - Automatic Control Enabler
		This is mainly a Quality of Life script for multiplayer environments. It lets you enable/disable Control Mode/Dash Mode and Combo Command Mode for each player. Death Cam makes the game automatically change a player's Control Mode to Auto if they die, and then reverts it back to whatever it was before death. Death Cam can be turned on/off on a per-player basis. May be unstable. Spaghetti code.
		
- Bug fixes:
	 - Xillia 1 and 2's Multiplayer Linking code wasn't working properly on the Newer CPUs version. Enemy linking now works as intended.
